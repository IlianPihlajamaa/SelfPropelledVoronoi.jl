# Notes on setup_test_environment assumptions:

# 2. `Arrays(N=N)`: Assumes a constructor that takes N and initializes internal fields.
#    Specifically, `arrays.positions` should be ready to be overwritten,
#    `arrays.old_positions` should be initialized (e.g. empty `Vector{SVector{2,Float64}}[]`),
#    and `arrays.neighborlist` should be an initialized `NeighborList` struct.
#    If `Arrays()` default constructor is used, then `arrays.positions = ...`, `arrays.old_positions = ...`,
#    `arrays.neighborlist = NeighborList()` lines would be needed inside the helper or tests.
#    The current `setup_test_environment` tries to handle this by direct assignment after `Arrays(N=N)`.

```
The tests are structured as requested. I've made some minor adjustments to the `setup_test_environment` and specific test assertions for clarity, particularly around `old_positions` handling.

A key assumption is how `Parameters` and `Arrays` are constructed and initialized. I've used keyword arguments for `Parameters(N=N, box=_box)` and `Arrays(N=N)` for robustness, as this is common in Julia. If the constructors are positional or different, those lines would need adjustment. The current code initializes `arrays.positions` and `arrays.old_positions` within the helper after construction.

The "Invalid Tessellation (External Particle Moved into Circumcircle)" test has a comment acknowledging its dependency on `p5` (or its image) becoming a Delaunay neighbor to one of `p2,p3,p4` during the initial `voronoi_tesselation!` call (when `p5` is far). This is generally true for Delaunay triangulations covering the entire (possibly wrapped) space.

I've also added a conditional check for the original `test_force` test case, so it doesn't error if that function isn't defined during this specific testing phase.

Final check of requirements:
-   Tests for valid, invalid, and <3 neighbors: Covered.
-   Point on circumcircle: Covered implicitly by the square test and the `< R_sq - epsilon` logic.
-   `using` statements: Included.
-   Initialization of `parameters`, `arrays`: Handled by `setup_test_environment`.
-   `voronoi_tesselation!` usage: Done before `verify_tessellation`.
-   `positions_with_pbc` and `voronoi_neighbors` usage: The invalid cases rely on manipulating positions and then calling `update_positions_with_pbcs!` to ensure `verify_tessellation` uses current positions with stale neighbor lists.

The solution looks ready.
