"""
This module is responsible for handling the saving of simulation state and data to files.
It provides functionality to dump snapshots of the simulation at specified intervals or conditions,
allowing for later analysis, visualization, or restarting of the simulation.

"""
    save_simulation_state!(parameters, arrays, output)

Saves the current state of the simulation to a file. This would typically involve
writing data such as particle positions, forces, orientations, simulation parameters,
and current output values (like energy and step number) to a structured file format
(e.g., HDF5).

**Note:** The current implementation is a placeholder and does not perform any actual
saving operations. It simply returns `nothing`.

# Arguments
- `parameters::ParameterStruct`: The main simulation parameter struct, containing all simulation settings.
- `arrays::ArrayStruct`: The struct holding the current state arrays of the simulation (e.g., particle positions, forces, orientations, areas, perimeters).
- `output::Output`: The struct holding current simulation output data (e.g., potential energy, steps done).

# Returns
- `nothing`
