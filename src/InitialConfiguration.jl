"""
This module is responsible for setting up the initial state of the
SelfPropelledVoronoi simulation. This includes, but is not limited to,
determining initial particle positions, orientations, and any other
relevant parameters that define the starting configuration of the system.

Currently, this module may be empty or underdeveloped, with more specific
initialization routines to be added as the simulation framework evolves.
