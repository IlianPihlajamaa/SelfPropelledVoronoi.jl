    replace_or_push!(array, value, index)

Modifies an `array` in-place by either replacing an element at a specified `index` or
pushing a new `value` onto the end of the array.

The behavior is as follows:
- If `index` is within the current bounds of the `array` (i.e., `1 <= index <= length(array)`),
  the element at `array[index]` is replaced with `value`.
- If `index` is one greater than the current length of the `array` (i.e., `index == length(array) + 1`),
  the `value` is pushed onto the end of the `array` using `push!`.
- If `index` is out of these bounds (e.g., less than 1, or greater than `length(array) + 1`),
  an `ArgumentError` is thrown.

# Arguments
- `array`: The array to be modified. This array is changed in-place.
- `value`: The value to be inserted into the `array` or pushed onto its end.
- `index::Integer`: The index at which to replace the existing element, or the position
  (equal to `length(array) + 1`) where the new element should be pushed.

# Returns
- The function does not explicitly return a value (`nothing` is implicitly returned if an `ArgumentError` is not thrown). The primary effect is the modification of the input `array`.

# Throws
- `ArgumentError`: If `index` is not within the valid range for replacement or pushing (i.e., if `index < 1` or `index > length(array) + 1`).

"""
    update_positions_with_pbcs!(parameters, arrays, output)

Creates an extended list of particle positions that includes the original particles
and their periodic images located within a defined boundary layer around the
simulation box. This extended list is essential for Voronoi tessellation algorithms
to correctly construct Voronoi cells for particles near the boundaries of the
periodic domain.

The function first adds all original particle positions. Then, for each original
particle, it checks if it's close to any of the box boundaries (left, right, bottom, top)
or corners. If a particle is within `pbc_layer_depth` of a boundary, its corresponding
periodic image(s) across that boundary (or corner) are added to the list.

The generated list of positions (`arrays.neighborlist.positions_with_pbc`) and a
corresponding list of original particle indices (`arrays.neighborlist.position_indices`)
are stored in the `arrays.neighborlist` structure.

# Arguments
- `parameters::ParameterStruct`: The main simulation parameter struct, providing:
- `arrays::ArrayStruct`: The struct holding simulation arrays.
- `output::Output`: The simulation output struct. Not directly used in this function but included for consistency in function signatures.

# Notes
- The fields `arrays.neighborlist.positions_with_pbc` and `arrays.neighborlist.position_indices` are modified in-place.

"""
    voronoi_tessellation!(parameters, arrays, output)

Performs a full Voronoi tessellation of the system based on current particle positions.
This function orchestrates several steps to compute the Voronoi diagram, which is
dual to the Delaunay triangulation. The results, including lists of Voronoi neighbors,
vertex positions, and topological information, are stored in `arrays.neighborlist`.

The process involves:
1.  **Update Positions with PBC**: Calls `update_positions_with_pbcs!` to generate an extended list of particle positions, including periodic images necessary for correct tessellation across boundaries. This list is stored in `arrays.neighborlist.positions_with_pbc`.
2.  **Delaunay Triangulation**: Computes the Delaunay triangulation of the extended particle positions using `Quickhull.delaunay`.
3.  **Process Delaunay Facets**: Iterates through each facet (triangle) of the Delaunay triangulation:
    *   The three particles forming the triangle are identified as Voronoi neighbors of each other. These are added to `arrays.neighborlist.voronoi_neighbors`.
    *   The circumcenter of the Delaunay triangle is calculated using the `circumcenter` function. This circumcenter is a Voronoi vertex. It's added to a global list of `voronoi_vertices` and also to `arrays.neighborlist.voronoi_vertex_positions_per_particle` for each of the three particles forming the triangle.
    *   The index of this new Voronoi vertex is added to `arrays.neighborlist.voronoi_vertex_indices` for each of the three particles.
    *   A tuple of the three particle indices forming the triangle (cell centers sharing this Voronoi vertex) is stored in `arrays.neighborlist.cell_centers_that_share_a_vertex`.
4.  **Sort Voronoi Vertices**: For each of the original `N` particles, the collected Voronoi vertices associated with it are sorted in counter-clockwise order around the particle's actual position using `sort_indices_counter_clockwise`. This ensures a consistent representation of Voronoi cells. The sorted vertex indices and positions replace the unsorted ones in `arrays.neighborlist.voronoi_vertex_indices` and `arrays.neighborlist.voronoi_vertex_positions_per_particle` for the original particles.
5.  **Store Results**: All computed lists (global Voronoi vertices, neighbors per particle, vertex indices per particle, vertex positions per particle, and cell centers sharing a vertex) are stored in the corresponding fields of `arrays.neighborlist`.

# Arguments
- `parameters::ParameterStruct`: The main simulation parameter struct.

- This function heavily modifies the `arrays.neighborlist` structure in-place.

    circumcenter(a::SVector{2, T}, b::SVector{2, T}, c::SVector{2, T}) where T

Calculates the circumcenter of a triangle defined by three 2D vertices `a`, `b`, and `c`.
The circumcenter is the point where the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle's sides intersect,
and it is equidistant from all three vertices. This point is also the center of the
triangle's circumcircle.

The calculation is based on a standard formula for the circumcenter's coordinates (ux, uy)
derived from the coordinates of the vertices (ax, ay), (bx, by), (cx, cy):
D = 2 * (ax * (by - cy) + bx * (cy - ay) + cx * (ay - by))
ux = (1/D) * ((ax^2 + ay^2) * (by - cy) + (bx^2 + by^2) * (cy - ay) + (cx^2 + cy^2) * (ay - by))

This function uses `norm2` which computes `ax^2 + ay^2` (squared length from origin).

# Arguments
- `a::SVector{2, T}`: The 2D coordinates of the first vertex of the triangle. `T` is its element type.
- `b::SVector{2, T}`: The 2D coordinates of the second vertex of the triangle. `T` is its element type.
- `c::SVector{2, T}`: The 2D coordinates of the third vertex of the triangle. `T` is its element type.

# Returns
- `SVector{2, Float64}`: The 2D coordinates `(ux, uy)` of the circumcenter. The coordinates are always returned as `Float64`, regardless of the input type `T`.

# Notes
- If the three points `a`, `b`, `c` are collinear, the denominator `D` will be zero, leading to `Inf` or `NaN` coordinates. In such cases, a warning is issued, and a small random displacement is added to the points to avoid undefined behavior.

# Notes
- The function assumes that the Voronoi tessellation has already been computed and that the necessary fields in `arrays.neighborlist` are populated, including `delaunay_facet_triplets`, `positions_with_pbc`, and `voronoi_neighbors`.

"""
    function sort_indices_counter_clockwise!(neighborlist, particle)

Sorts the Voronoi vertex indices and their corresponding positions for a specific
particle's Voronoi cell in a counter-clockwise (CCW) order around the cell's center.

The sorting is achieved by calculating the angle of each vertex relative to the
`voronoi_center` (the particle's position) and then sorting based on these angles.
The `atan(dy, dx)` function is used to get angles in the range `(-Ï€, Ï€]`, which
naturally provides an ordering for CCW sorting.

# Arguments
- `neighborlist`: The `NeighborList` struct containing Voronoi data, including vertex indices and positions.
- `particle::Int`: The index of the particle whose Voronoi cell vertices are to be sorted.
